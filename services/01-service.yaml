# #### after creation of 2 pods and 1 service 
#     login to the debug pod using command :  kubectl exec -it debug -- bash
#     curl http://nginx-service
#     then you will get the response....
#     also try with the other pod and check whether service is responding or not response....
#     like this you can attach any number of pods. and the service can also be used as a load balancer.
#     CLUSTER IP IS ONLY FOR POD TO POD...WE CANT ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE.
#     TO ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE WE HAVE NODE PORT
